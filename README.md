This project aims at building an infrastructure to configure, distribute and maintain a network of Tor bridges in the context of a single entity.

The core components include:

* flashrd http://www.nmedia.net/flashrd/

* custom flashrd build scripts

* static web page generator for local statistics

* a user questionnaire for acquiring the details necessary for Tor bridge configuration

* a "hub" server for monitoring the Tor bridges and for distributing system updates

This project is in its very early days, with a number of critical components still in the brainstorm stage.
